a. A complete zipped workspace of a fully functional RTMK.
b. A report ( .Doc or .Docx or .Pdf ) documenting the work done of a minimum of 2000 words. The report should, at least, include the following items:

3. The organisation of the report (a summary of one paragraph).
■ Operation of the RTMK section that details the implemented OS works with the help of an illustrating Flow Chart Diagram with a written explanation.
■ Assisting libraries section to fulfil the project requirements (Linked Lists or others).
■ A Testing section that includes:
1. For each function implemented in the assisting libraries or the
RTMK the student should write unit tests and provide a description of those unit tests.
